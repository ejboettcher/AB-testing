## A / B Testing { background-image='img/bluebox.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }

A/B testing is a **randomized** controlled experiment done in production.

<br>
There are two tests: A and B, in which a single variable adjusted (B Test).
<br>
<br>
This variation, **might** affect a user's behavior.
<br>

![](./img/ab.svg)

<br>

#### Goal: Increase End User's Objective

* **Business:** Income increases >> Costs of change
* **Health Care:**  Health increases >> Side effect

:::{.notes}

* Not explicitly telling users they are in a test
* "User" is loosely used.  It could be servers, Say testing speed: Google vs AWS cloud

- Why risk angering your customers with changes?
- I got data miners, I do not need tests!

### Life is complicated. 

Domain knowledge only gets you so far!

<br>

Subject-matter experts (SME) from Microsoft, Netflixs etc, find when they implement changes 
that only a small fraction of their ideas have the planned outcome [@sweet].

<br>

Even though we are isolating a single variable, 
that variable interacts with a million other variables.
<br>
You simply can not model everything or know everything.

### Trader Janes has a New Pizza
Say there is a grocer called Trader Janes and it wants to add a new pizza to its line up.
<br>
However, they need to keep the same number of types it sells a constant.
Freezer only holds N pizzas.

<br>
They will have to remove one pizza from their lineup to add the new item.
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Typical Work flow

- Marketing asks a _Data Miner_ to rank popularity of pizza.
- The Data Miner finds the pizza that sells the least.
- Stores remove that pizza.
- Stores add new pizza.

## A / B Testing Limitations { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }


A/B Testing is used to clarify a vision, but does not create vision.

<br>

For example, an ophthalmologist quickly gives you a set of two choices; 
1 or 2 (2 or 3) that lead to sharpen vision.  Their test, like A/B, can not give you vision.

<br>

##### Though without a clarity,  a vision has serious limitation.

How does A/B testing fit  
into the DevOps?

<br>
<br>



* (from The Pheonix Project [@pheonix])

:::
:::{.column width=75%}

### The Three Ways for DevOps 

**The First Way:** Principles of Flow

- Making work “visible” by defining a work flow


**The Second Way:** Principles of Feedback

- Have fast and constant feedback cycles throughout all stages of a development
- Don't throw it over the wall 
    
    
**Third Way:** Principles of Continuous Learning

- Create a culture of continual learning and experimentation

## Reducing Costs { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### Minimal Viable Product

Need to create the smallest, fastest A/B Test that is statistically meaningful.

<br>
<br> 

### How do you minimize the number of samples (N)?

<br>

Want an N samples that show a 5% false positive and 20% false negative.

<br>

$$
N = ?
$$

---

## { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### Use Statistics 

<br>

Defines minimum number of samples (**N**) as:

$$
N > 2.48 \left( \frac{\sigma_\Delta}{\Delta} \right)^2
$$

<hr>

- $\Delta$: How much of a difference is needed to make the change
  - It cost money to make a change
  - Increase to bottom line needs to be significant, to accept risk
    -  _Example_: Trader Jane's Pizza needs sales to increase by 3%
- $\sigma_\Delta$: estimated by business historical data
  - $\sigma_\Delta$ = $~\sqrt{2 \sigma_{log}^2}$
    - $\sigma_{log}$: How much does sales fluctuate over a given time period.

---

## { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### Important

<br>

- #### Unless there is a clear, measurable advantage, no change should occur.

<br>

- #### There is no guarantee that change will be effective.

#### Bias and Harm

In addition, our testing and product should do **no** harm.

### Yeah,

we have our minimal viable test.

<br>


But we are not done yet.  

<br>

One more thing to worry about

<br>


### Can this (change/test) harm our customers?

---

## Do no Harm: F potential { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }

If we implement B, how F--ed up will that make the users?

<br>

If we tested B, how F--ed up will that make the users?

---

### Social Sites
A/B Testing is being done on users without consent, knowledge and at scale (100K of users).

<br>

Group mindset has been around since the 1950's.
Current research shows that our minds physically change when we work together [@change-minds] socially.

So it is scary to read 

* Facebook: Tested their algorithm to see if it really does radicalize people [@facebook-radical]
* LinkedIn: Tested on 20 million users to find out how links affect people's career/jobs [@linkedin-jobs]
* Facebook: Tested on 700,000 users to see if they can make them sad [@facebook-sad]

### Health Care

* Drug Companies: OxyContin [@oxycontin]
  * 1% addiction rate advertised (From non real world users)
  * 10-30% addiction rate in real life

---

## { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### Remedy

#### Good news

There are already strong standard for testing on human subjects.  
There is the IRB (Internal review board) preprocess.

<br>

It has required and continuous training and certification: CiTI training.

<br>


#### Bad news

Only required for companies receiving federal government funding: Universities, Air Force, Army etc.

<br>

Not required for companies that work with schools (state and local funding) and social media companies.

<br>

### F potential

In light of this, I propose researchers use the F potential.

<br>

(Currently, not a real thing.  Just something to think about.)

---

### $F_{upped}$  Potential

$$
F_{upped} =  \begin{cases}
       \text{1,} &\quad\text{if seriously harmed}\\
       \text{0.5,} &\quad\text{if slightly harmed} \\
       \text{0,} &\quad\text{if not measurable}\\
       \text{-0.5,} &\quad\text{becomes better} \\
       \text{-1,} &\quad\text{becomes a lot better} \\
     \end{cases}
$$

If $F_{upped}$ > 0, test should be a no-go.

If $F_{upped}$ < 0, $\Delta$ should be halved. 

* e.g. $\Delta$ is the amount of gain the company needs to make the change.

<br>

_Example_: Trader Jane's Pizza needs sales to increase by 3% ($\Delta$). <br>
If pizza made people better, then $\Delta=1.5\%$.

## One more thing to worry about { background-image='img/bluebox.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }

## Seen and Unseen Bias { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }

Biases can increase the F-potential. 

<br>
<hr>
<br>

Luckily, A/B Testing can help with both unseen and seen bias.



---

## { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### Example: Unseen Bias

I know of three small business that where started by **young** women 
in the Dayton area. 

<br>

Their original logo design used beautifully detailed font.

<br>

Unfortunately, this detailed font would make it difficult for people like me (over 40) to read it.

<br>
<hr>

They literally could see their logo.

<br>

#### However

Their logo was not readable to me when I drove by!

<br>
<hr>
<br>


#### This is an unseen bias.

These women (All of whom where lovely and kind) 
did not know that they made a 
logo could not be read by me.

## Known Bias { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### A/B Testing to reduce Researcher's Bias

* Frequency range of Human Voice: 90Hz to 14,000Hz
* Frequency range for the _Voice Spectrum_ over copper: 300Hz to 3,400Hz
* Men, Women and Children have different fundamental frequency

<br>

Most consonants spoken are in the 400 to 4500Hz.

<br>

With Women having most of their consonants sounds showing up in the higher frequency's.

<br>
**Green Bar** shows the cutoff for the _voice spectrum_

This caused women's voices to sound **shrill**.

It also made it hard to understand what they said, 
since their voice was cut off.

## { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### Bias has caused women to change.

Margret Thatcher during her career changed her voice. 

  * Dropped her main vocal frequency roughly 60Hz! [@shrill]
  * Almost a 1/3!

<br>

Women's voices have dropped on average over 23Hz from 1945 to 1993. [@journalofvoice]

<br>

Women's voices have been becoming more manly.

---

## { background-image='img/bluebox.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }
### Was the Voice Spectrum Biased: Yes

In 1927 a voice spectrum had to be defined.

<br>

J.C Steinberg (from AT&T) knew that the proposed voice frequency 
cut off women's voices.  He wrote a letter titled "_Understanding Women_".

<br>

He states that men traditionally have an inability to understand women except when their tone is soft.  
So, it is a "biological failing of women" [@shrill] that we can't understand them.  $\therefore$ _The technology as is, is good._  

<hr>

#### Market prospective

In A/B Testing, we focus on the question does doing A or B make the company more successful.

* Women make up 1/2 the market.  

When another company/technology comes along 
that cover's women's voices better, 
it is reasonable to assume that they will get that market share.

- Who has a landline?

## Voice Bias in 21st century? { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }

With more diverse workforce, a research(er) bias  will go down.  

- **True**

<br>
<hr>
<br>

##### But, there is still unseen bias in voice in the 21st century!

<br>

Google and Apple had a hard time getting voice recognition 
to work for kids [@kids_voice]

<br>

Not only do kids speak at higher frequencies than women, they have different speaking patterns.

<br>

One can not simply take an adult's voice and shift the frequency.
So ML/AI have a hard time figuring what kids are saying.

<br>

### Why kids are important

The market for voice recognition for kids looks to have a strong market growth.

## Conclusion { background-image='img/blue_shape.svg' background-size="100% 100% " background-position="0%  center" }


A/B testing is a **randomized** controlled experiment done **in production**.

<br>
There are two tests: A and B, in which a single variable adjusted (B Test).
<br>

This variation, **might** affect a user's behavior.
 

<hr>
<br>

### Your A/B Testing should:

* Make the company more successful.
* Follow some ethical guidelines, like the **$F_{upped}$** potential
   - If $F_{upped}$ > 0, test should be a no-go.
   - If $F_{upped}$ < 0, $\Delta$ should be halved. 

<br>
<hr>
<br>

### A/B Testing has Risk

No free lunch.  
Even after testing, test results might not make the company more successful.
