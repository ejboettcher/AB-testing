A/B Testing is a powerful tool.  
It is used to increase user engagement on websites to driving business decisions 
and is a key aspect to the lean startup business model.  
It can even be used to optimize machine learning (ML) algorithms hyperparameters. 
There is a reason why companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google conduct over 
10,000 online controlled experiments annually and that is because it moves progress 
forward quickly.  A/B Testing done well can drive innovation and increase revenue. 
At the most basic concept it is two tests:  a controlled test and a test with a single change.  
These two tests: A and B are run simultaneously and measured against a user defined metric. 
This  talk will go over A/B testing and how one can add the infrastructure to enable the use 
of controlled experimentation through A/B testing to help maximize the company profits.
